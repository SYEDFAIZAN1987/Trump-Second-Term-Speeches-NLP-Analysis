## President Donald J. Trump Second Term Speeches: A Natural Language Processing Based Analysis

### Overview
This repository contains an **NLP-based analysis** of **President Donald J. Trump's second-term speeches** using **NLTK, Scikit-Learn, and BERT Transformers**. The project aims to extract key linguistic patterns, topic distributions, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition from his speeches.

### The source of the Data
The source of the speeches was 'The American Presidency Project' maintained by the University of Santa Barbara. The speeches and addresses used were of the following categories:
1. Interviews
2. News Conferences
3. Spoken Addresses and Remarks
4. Farewell Addresses
5. Inaugural Addresses
   The pool reports were not included as they are mediated via reportage.

### üîç Objectives of the Analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis** using **BERT Transformer Model**
- **N-gram Analysis** (Bigrams & Quadgrams)
- **Topic Modeling** using **NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)**
- **Named Entity Recognition** for frequently mentioned **leaders, cabinet members, and countries**
- **Word Cloud Analysis** of frequently used **adjectives, nouns, and verbs**
- **Speech Engagement Analysis** (Applause & Laughter frequency)
- **Immigration-Related Word Cloud Analysis**
